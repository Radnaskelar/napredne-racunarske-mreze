\# Node HTTP Server – Networking Demo



A Node.js project that demonstrates \*\*HTTP over TCP\*\* using Node’s built-in `http` module (no frameworks).

Built to illustrate request/response, routing, headers, and serving HTML + JSON.



\## What it shows

\- HTTP server on top of TCP (HTTP/1.1 keep-alive by default)

\- Request parsing (method, path, query) and simple routing

\- Response headers (`Content-Type`, status codes) and payloads (HTML/JSON)

\- Reading data and templates from files to build responses
